# etch-a-sketch

This project was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It features an interactive canvas that allows you to draw images by mousing over an area of the canvas. The project uses DOM manipulation and event listeners to change the sketching mode, alter the grid size, and reset the canvas.

To get started, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a blank canvas that is ready to be sketched on. By default, the sketching mode is set to black and white.

To draw on the canvas, simply move your mouse over the area you want to sketch on. The sketching mode will determine the color and style of your drawing. You can change the sketching mode by clicking on one of the buttons labeled "Random Colors" or "Shading."

The grid size can also be altered by clicking on the "Change Grid" button. The prompt will accept numbers between 1 and 100. The default grid size is 16x16, but you can increase or decrease it as desired.

Finally, if you want to start over with a blank canvas in black and white, simply click on the "Reset" button.

We hope you enjoy using our Etch-a-Sketch project! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for checking out my project!
